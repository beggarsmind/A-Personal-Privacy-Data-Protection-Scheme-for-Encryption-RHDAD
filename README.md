# A-Personal-Privacy-Data-Protection-Scheme-for-Encryption-RHDAD

This project focuses on securing high-dimensional personal data using AES encryption and efficient revocation mechanisms. It ensures data confidentiality, access control, and dynamic user management. Users can only access authorized attributes, and revoked users lose access without requiring re-encryption of the entire dataset. The system is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, with proxy re-encryption for secure key updates. This approach enhances privacy, scalability, and compliance with data protection regulations, making it ideal for safeguarding sensitive information.

Introduction
Organizations collect vast amounts of high-dimensional data (datasets with many attributes per record), which often contain sensitive information. Protecting such data is challenging due to:

The risk of unauthorized access
The complexity of encryption in high-dimensional datasets
The need for efficient user revocation without affecting legitimate users
This project provides a secure encryption scheme with revocation capabilities, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify the data.

Objectives
Secure Data Storage: Implement encryption to protect high-dimensional personal data.
Efficient Revocation: Design a scheme to revoke access without re-encrypting the entire dataset.
Access Control: Ensure only authorized users can retrieve and use specific attributes.
Performance Optimization: Maintain a balance between security and computational efficiency.
Technology Stack
Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for user interface and encryption settings)
Back-End: PHP (for access control and user authentication)
Database: MySQL (for secure data storage)
Encryption Algorithm: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for securing high-dimensional data
Methodology
1. Data Encryption:
Each high-dimensional data attribute is encrypted using AES encryption.
The system assigns unique encryption keys for different data attributes.
Users can only decrypt permitted attributes based on their access level.
2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):
Access permissions are assigned based on user roles (e.g., Admin, User, Guest).
Users can view only relevant attributes, enhancing data privacy.
3. User Revocation Mechanism:
When a user is revoked, their decryption key is invalidated without re-encrypting the entire database.
Key Revocation Technique: Uses a proxy re-encryption mechanism to update access rights dynamically.
4. Secure Data Sharing:
Users can securely share specific encrypted attributes with others while preventing unauthorized disclosure.
Results and Benefits
Enhanced Data Security: Sensitive attributes remain encrypted and inaccessible to unauthorized users.
Scalability: Efficient handling of high-dimensional data without excessive computational overhead.
Flexible User Management: Smooth addition/removal of users without affecting existing ones.
Compliance: Meets privacy regulations such as GDPR and Data Protection Laws.
Conclusion
This project successfully implements a secure, efficient, and scalable data protection scheme for high-dimensional personal information. By integrating encryption and revocation techniques, it ensures confidentiality, access control, and dynamic user management, making it highly applicable for organizations handling sensitive user data.
